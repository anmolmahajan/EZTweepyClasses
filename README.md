# EZTweepyClasses - Twitter Searcher based on account names and keywords
An easy interface for collecting twitter data through tweepy. For NLP, I will be creating a separate repository when I clean up my hacky scripts. 

 Step 1. Apply for developer account on twitter
 Step 2. Create an App from the developer menu
 Step 3. Copy your 4 keys from the 'Keys and Tokens' section of your app and paste sequentially starting line 13
 Step 4. You can call objects for both types of search classes below, this can be automated for multiple entries
         using a list of usernames/keywords and a for loop to iterate through search objects.
 Note: Uncomment the builders when running for the first time
